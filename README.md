### High-Accuracy Brain Tumor Classification from MRI Images using CNN-Based Deep Learning
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/adityasawaks/High-Accuracy-Brain-Tumor-Classification-from-MRI-Images-using-CNN-Based-Deep-Learning)
Utilizing deep learning techniques, this project aims to classify brain tumors from MRI images for early detection and treatment planning.
The dataset comprises 7023 MRI images categorized into glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary classes.
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model achieves high accuracy in classification, with precision, recall, and F1-score exceeding 0.96 for all classes.
The model architecture includes convolutional and pooling layers followed by dense layers, totaling over 2 million trainable parameters, facilitating comprehensive tumor detection and location identification.
